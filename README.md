# Restaurant-menu-java
A program that is used for restaurant orders. The program reads the menu from a file and will allow the customer to choose what they want and place an order.

#### The menu is structured as a text file where each item in it will consist of 3 lines-
The first line represents the description of the item (free text),the second line is the type of item (first order/ main/ last course/ drink) and the last line is the price of the item.

## Using the program:
- When the customer finishes choosing the desired items, he will click on the "Order" button and receive a dialog box listing the order details (including price).
- The user will be able to choose between the following possibilities: confirming the order, updating the order or its cancellation.
- In case of an update request, the system will allow the user to change the order and then the user will be able to press the "time" button again.
- In the case of approval, the system will ask the user to enter his name accompanied by an ID number (eg: Yossi123456789) and save the order items in a text file whose name is the same as the entered name (it can be assumed that the name is unique). After that, the system will return to the main screen and allow you to make another order.
- In case of cancellation, the system will return to the main screen and allow another order to be made.

#### An example menu file is attached.
